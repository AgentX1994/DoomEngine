# Doom Engine

This is a simple WIP for a Doom-like engine in C++. Currently only draws a simple square to the screen. This is mainly a project to practice software architecture and readibility, along with working on complex projects with terminal tools rather than a full IDE. Works in macOS, using OpenGL and GLFW3, with dependencies on the Cocoa, IOKit, and Core Video frameworks.

# Features

- screen class for the screen

# TODO
- Define UV coordinates for the screen
- Develop a shader to draw vertical lines for walls, ceilings, and floors
